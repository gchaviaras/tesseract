// gst_class is a "/"-separated device class ("Audio/Source", "Video/Sink",

// For audio the returned id is a PulseAudio/PipeWire source or sink name; for
// video it is the /dev/videoN path. The video id matters: it is what
// VideoCapture::start() injects into the v4l2src pipeline, so it has to be a
// real device path rather than anything provider-specific.
