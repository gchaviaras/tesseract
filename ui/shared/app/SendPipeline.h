// Per-room ordered send queue with an optional slow "prepare" step, plus a
// per-room busy signal for the composer's send-button spinner.
//
// Some sends need work before the event can be built (today: generating
// MSC4095 bundled URL previews, which can take seconds). That work must not
// run on the single `&mut` FFI worker, or every other mutating call (room
// switches, reactions, edits) would queue behind it. So a send is split in
// two: `prepare` runs on the read pool, and `send` (given prepare's result)
// runs on the `&mut` worker. Sends for one room are handed to the `&mut`
// worker strictly in submission order: a later send whose prepare finished
// first (or that needs none) waits for the earlier ones. Rooms never wait
// for each other.
//
// A room is reported busy once it has had a send outstanding (preparing,
// queued, or sending) for `kBusyDelayMs`, and idle again when its last send
// finishes, so ordinary sends never flash the spinner.
//
// UI-thread only, except that `prepare`/`send` run on the workers the hooks
// dispatch them to. The owner's `post_ui` / `post_ui_after` hooks must be
// liveness-guarded (continuations posted after the owner dies must no-op).
