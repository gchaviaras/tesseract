// Reusable "am I still alive?" mixin for classes that hand deferred/async

// `std::shared_ptr<bool> alive_` + manual `weak_ptr<bool>` capture-and-check
// idiom that used to be reimplemented independently by several classes.
//
// Usage:
//   class Foo : public tk::EnableWeakSelf<Foo>
//   {
//       ~Foo() { invalidate_weak_self(); /* first statement, before any
//                                            member teardown */ ... }
//       void start()

//       }
//   };
//
// tk::Widget itself inherits EnableWeakSelf<Widget> (see widget.h) — its own
// self_alive_/track<T>() mechanism was unified onto this same class. Widget
// subclasses (ComposeBar, MessageListView, etc.) do NOT add their own second
// EnableWeakSelf<T> base; they just use the inherited guarded()/weak_flag(),
// and — if they have their own members that must stop being touched before
// their own teardown starts — call the same inherited invalidate_weak_self()
// again as the first statement of their own destructor (see below).
//
// *** Only ONE class per inheritance chain should ever inherit
// *** EnableWeakSelf<T>. Do not add it again in a subclass "for its own
// *** members" — weak_flag()/weak_self()/guarded() are protected, so any
// *** subclass already inherits them and can call them directly. Re-adding
// *** EnableWeakSelf<Derived> as a second base is NOT reliably caught by the
// *** compiler: it only fails if Derived calls one of these names
// *** unqualified (which becomes ambiguous between the two instantiations).
// *** If Derived never does — e.g. it only ever calls a qualified
// *** `EnableWeakSelf<Derived>::guarded(...)`, or happens not to need
// *** guarded()/weak_self() itself and only added the base for
// *** invalidate_weak_self() — the second base compiles silently, sits
// *** unused, and gives Derived a lifetime guard that nothing ever
// *** invalidates. There is deliberately no compile-time trap for this here:
// *** the natural fix (a shared marker base whose ambiguous-conversion
// *** triggers a hard error) relies on ambiguous-base-conversion behavior in
// *** is_convertible/static_cast that is not reliably SFINAE-friendly across
// *** MSVC/GCC/Clang, and this header is used from all four platforms' UI
// *** code — not worth risking an intermittent, hard-to-diagnose
// *** cross-compiler miscompile to catch a mistake that (so far) has never
// *** actually gone unnoticed in practice, since every real use of this
// *** mixin calls invalidate_weak_self() in its destructor as the whole
// *** point of adding it. If you're adding EnableWeakSelf<Derived> to a class
// *** whose base ALREADY inherits EnableWeakSelf<Base> (of any base, however
// *** many levels up) — stop, you don't need it: see the Base/Derived
// *** example below instead.
//
// If the subclass has its OWN members that must stop being touched before
// ITS teardown starts (not just before the base's), have the subclass's own
// destructor call the SAME inherited invalidate_weak_self() as its first
// statement too — it's idempotent (resets an already-null shared_ptr), so
// the base's later call (if any) is just a harmless no-op:
//
//   class Base : public tk::EnableWeakSelf<Base> { ... };
//   class Derived : public Base
//   {
//       ~Derived() { invalidate_weak_self(); /* protects Derived's own
//                                                members too, before they're
//                                                destroyed */ ... }
//   };

// Returned by EnableWeakSelf::ui_poster(); see there. Holds only a copy of
// the owner's UI-thread executor and a weak liveness token — never the
// owner itself — so it is safe to carry into and use from a worker thread.
